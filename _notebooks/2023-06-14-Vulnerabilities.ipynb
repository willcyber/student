    "## SQL Injection\n",
    "Before you read anything about SQL Injection, make sure you understand everything in the \"Basic Knowledge\" section\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker maliciously inserts or \"injects\" unauthorized SQL code into a database query. It takes advantage of improper handling of user-supplied input, typically in a web application that interacts with a database using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused? Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to buy a gift on Amazon and go to this link https://amazon.com/products?category=Gifts\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes the SQL query to retrieve details from the database\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "- \"*\" = everything\n",
    "- Products = table name\n",
    "- The restricts are that the category is ‘Gifts’ and released is equal to 1 (in this example this means the gift is released)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we want to get stuff from the database that isn’t released? How would we bypass the “released=1”?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where SQL injection comes into play! Before we tackle how to do it, let’s go over some syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two dashes (--) is an SQL comment\n",
    "- || is concatenate\n",
    "- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'william' AND password = 'Password1!'\n",
    "    - Stuff between single quotes are strings\n",
    "    - Everything else is an SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT\n",
    "- A single quote (‘) helps you break out of a string and write more SQL query!\n",
    "- “AND” statement always runs before “OR” statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are getting into the good stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the attack works\n",
